# Monster Train 2 Relics Reloaded

Brings back several of the artifacts from the original Monster Train to Monster Train 2.

# Features

- Brings back 38 artifacts which were in the original Monster Train to Monster Train 2 (See the full list below)
- Their stats remain the same, but they will be updated in the future to match the stats on the newer relics
- The two missing artifacts will be implemented once they are supported by the Trainworks framework

# Installation

Install via Thunderstore or manually: copy the mod contents to the 'BepInEx/plugins' folder of your Monster Train 2 installation directory.

# Warning

This is a non-cosmetic mod that changes the game mechanics. Do not use it while playing any online mode as it may cause you to be banned.

Since the pool of artifacts will be highly diluted because of this mod, I suggest installing other mods to increase the number of artifacts you can encounter in the game to make sure you get an artifact that is crucial for your run.
